# LipRead - Deep Learning Lip Reading Application

LipRead is a sophisticated deep learning application that can read lips from mute videos using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The project uses a combination of 3D CNNs and Bidirectional LSTMs to achieve accurate lip reading predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time lip reading from video input
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Support for video file upload and processing
- Visual feedback showing model's video processing
- Deep learning model with 3D CNNs and Bidirectional LSTMs

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **TensorFlow** - Deep learning framework
- **Streamlit** - Web interface
- **FFmpeg** - Video processing
- **OpenCV** - Image processing

## 📊 Model Architecture

The deep learning model consists of:
- Multiple 3D Convolutional layers for spatial-temporal feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Bidirectional LSTM layers for sequence learning
- Dense layer with softmax activation for classification
- Dropout layers for regularization
